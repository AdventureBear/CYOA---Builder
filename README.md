This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Creating a New Adventure (CYOA Skeleton)

To create a new adventure, you only need to provide two data files:

- `data/scenes.ts` (or `data/scenes.json`)
- `data/actions.ts` (or `data/actions.json`)

### Scenes Format
Each scene is an object with the following structure:

```ts
{
  id: string, // unique scene ID
  name: string, // scene title
  text: string, // scene description
  location: string, // location name
  season: string, // time/season
  storyPhase: string, // e.g. 'ACT_I', 'ACT_II', etc.
  isRequired: boolean, // is this scene required for main story?
  imageUrl?: string, // optional image
  actions?: string[], // optional action IDs to trigger
  choices: [
    {
      text: string, // choice text
      nextScene: string, // ID of next scene
      alignment?: string // optional alignment or tag
    },
    // ...
  ]
}
```

### Actions Format
Each action is an object with the following structure:

```ts
{
  id: string, // unique action ID
  trigger: 'onEnter' | 'onExit' | 'onChoice',
  conditions?: [ /* array of condition objects */ ],
  outcomes: [
    {
      description: string,
      stateChanges?: [ /* array of state change objects */ ],
      choices?: [
        { text: string, nextAction: string, alignment?: string }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Scenes vs. Actions: Key Differences

#### Scenes
- **Definition:** A scene represents a location or moment in the story. It contains narrative text, a list of actions that occur when the player enters or interacts, and a set of choices that let the player move to other scenes.
- **Purpose:** To set the context, describe what's happening, and present the player with choices for where to go next.
- **Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "id": "oak_tree",
    "location": "Under the Oak Tree",
    "text": "Hazel finds a baby bird on the ground, chirping for help.",
    "actions": ["help_bird"],
    "choices": [
      { "text": "Return to the clearing", "nextNodeId": "intro" }
    ]
  }
  ```

#### Actions
- **Definition:** Actions are events or interactions that happen within a scene. They can have outcomes, state changes, and may chain to other actions, but do not move the player to a new scene.
- **Purpose:** To handle logic, consequences, and branching events that occur as part of the scene's narrative.
- **Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "id": "help_bird",
    "trigger": "onEnter",
    "outcomes": [
      {
        "description": "You help the baby bird back to its nest.",
        "stateChanges": [{ "type": "setFlag", "key": "helped_bird" }]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

#### Quick Reference Table

| Aspect         | Scene                                      | Action                                 |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| What is it?    | Location/moment in the story               | Event or interaction within a scene    |
| Contains       | Narrative, actions, choices                | Outcomes, state changes, logic         |
| Moves player?  | Yes (via choices to other scenes)          | No (may chain to other actions)        |
| Example        | "Forest Clearing", "Oak Tree"              | "help_bird", "share_nuts"              |

### How to Use
1. Copy the repo.
2. Replace the contents of `data/scenes.ts` and `data/actions.ts` with your own adventure data, following the above format.
3. Set your initial scene ID and story phase in the game state config.
4. Run the appâ€”your new adventure is ready!

See the `data/` directory for example files.

## Modal System and Game State

### Centralized Modal Store
The game uses a global modal store (with Zustand) to manage the stack of modals. This means:
- There is a single source of truth for what modal(s) are currently open.
- Components can **push** (open) or **pop** (close) modals from anywhere in the app.

#### Typical Modal Store API
- `push(modalData)`: Adds a new modal to the stack (shows it).
- `pop()`: Removes the top modal from the stack (closes it).
- `current()`: Returns the current (top) modal, or `null` if none.

### How Modals Are Triggered in Game Flow
- When an action or choice is made (e.g., player selects a choice, enters a scene, triggers an event), your game logic may want to show a modal (for a result, outcome, or message).
- The code will call `useModalStore.getState().push(modalData)` to show a modal.
- The modal data includes things like:
  - `description` (text to show)
  - `choices` (buttons/options)
  - `buttonText` (for a single button)
  - `type` (inline or popover, if you support both)

**Example:**
```js
useModalStore.getState().push({
  id: 'some-unique-id',
  description: 'You found a treasure!',
  buttonText: 'Continue',
});
```

### How Modals Are Closed
- When the player clicks a button or makes a choice, you call `useModalStore.getState().pop()`.
- This removes the current modal from the stack.
- If there are more modals underneath, the next one is shown; if not, no modal is shown.

**Example:**
```js
// On button click:
useModalStore.getState().pop();
```

### How This Relates to Game State
- Modals are used to display outcomes, results, or choices that are the result of game state changes.
- Sometimes, when a modal is closed (popped), you may want to trigger further game logic (e.g., advance to the next scene, apply state changes, etc.).
- This is often handled in the button/choice handler, which may:
  - Apply state changes to the game state.
  - Push another modal (for chained events).
  - Or just pop the modal to return to the main game UI.

### Example Flow
1. Player makes a choice.
2. Game logic applies state changes (e.g., adds an item, sets a flag).
3. Game logic pushes a modal to show the result:
   ```js
   useModalStore.getState().push({
     id: 'result-1',
     description: 'You found a key!',
     buttonText: 'Continue',
   });
   ```
4. Player clicks "Continue".
5. Modal is popped:
   ```js
   useModalStore.getState().pop();
   ```
6. Game continues, possibly with new state or another modal.

### Chaining Modals
- You can push multiple modals in sequence (e.g., for a series of results).
- Each time the player clicks, you pop the current modal, and the next one (if any) is shown.

### Where to Look in the Code
- The modal store is likely in `store/modalStore.ts`.
- Look for functions like `push`, `pop`, and `current`.
- The modal rendering logic (e.g., `InlineGameModal`) will use `useModalStore((state) => state.current())` to get the current modal to display.

### Summary Table

| Action                | What Happens                                 |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `push(modalData)`     | Shows a new modal (adds to stack)            |
| `pop()`               | Closes the current modal (removes from stack)|
| `current()`           | Gets the current modal to display            |
