This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Creating a New Adventure (CYOA Skeleton)

To create a new adventure, you only need to provide two data files:

- `data/scenes.ts` (or `data/scenes.json`)
- `data/actions.ts` (or `data/actions.json`)

### Scenes Format
Each scene is an object with the following structure:

```ts
{
  id: string, // unique scene ID
  name: string, // scene title
  text: string, // scene description
  location: string, // location name
  season: string, // time/season
  storyPhase: string, // e.g. 'ACT_I', 'ACT_II', etc.
  isRequired: boolean, // is this scene required for main story?
  imageUrl?: string, // optional image
  actions?: string[], // optional action IDs to trigger
  choices: [
    {
      text: string, // choice text
      nextScene: string, // ID of next scene
      alignment?: string // optional alignment or tag
    },
    // ...
  ]
}
```

### Actions Format
Each action is an object with the following structure:

```ts
{
  id: string, // unique action ID
  trigger: 'onEnter' | 'onExit' | 'onChoice',
  conditions?: [ /* array of condition objects */ ],
  outcomes: [
    {
      description: string,
      stateChanges?: [ /* array of state change objects */ ],
      choices?: [
        { text: string, nextAction: string, alignment?: string }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Scenes vs. Actions: Key Differences

#### Scenes
- **Definition:** A scene represents a location or moment in the story. It contains narrative text, a list of actions that occur when the player enters or interacts, and a set of choices that let the player move to other scenes.
- **Purpose:** To set the context, describe what's happening, and present the player with choices for where to go next.
- **Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "id": "oak_tree",
    "location": "Under the Oak Tree",
    "text": "Hazel finds a baby bird on the ground, chirping for help.",
    "actions": ["help_bird"],
    "choices": [
      { "text": "Return to the clearing", "nextNodeId": "intro" }
    ]
  }
  ```

#### Actions
- **Definition:** Actions are events or interactions that happen within a scene. They can have outcomes, state changes, and may chain to other actions, but do not move the player to a new scene.
- **Purpose:** To handle logic, consequences, and branching events that occur as part of the scene's narrative.
- **Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "id": "help_bird",
    "trigger": "onEnter",
    "outcomes": [
      {
        "description": "You help the baby bird back to its nest.",
        "stateChanges": [{ "type": "setFlag", "key": "helped_bird" }]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

#### Quick Reference Table

| Aspect         | Scene                                      | Action                                 |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| What is it?    | Location/moment in the story               | Event or interaction within a scene    |
| Contains       | Narrative, actions, choices                | Outcomes, state changes, logic         |
| Moves player?  | Yes (via choices to other scenes)          | No (may chain to other actions)        |
| Example        | "Forest Clearing", "Oak Tree"              | "help_bird", "share_nuts"              |

### How to Use
1. Copy the repo.
2. Replace the contents of `data/scenes.ts` and `data/actions.ts` with your own adventure data, following the above format.
3. Set your initial scene ID and story phase in the game state config.
4. Run the appâ€”your new adventure is ready!

See the `data/` directory for example files.
